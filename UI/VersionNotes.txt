<color #AA44FF>TLMv13.5</color>
	- Added support to <color yellow>More Vehicles</color> mod. Some statatistics may be lost when converting a savegame to use that mod, but it's harmless.
	- Fixed some Write the Signs integration bugs.

<color yellow>Update r1:</color> Fixed game sometimes freezing when saving. 
	<color #FF8800>IMPORTANT NOTE: Some stats data will be lost due More Vehicles compatibility implementation!</color>
